TODO

Should ConnPool get a Connect func, or a Connector interface?
ConnConfigConnectFunc not a very great name
ConnPool logger not from first Conn
New logger interface
Conn.CauseOfDeath name -- maybe something better or remove -- along with IsAlive
Fix ConnPool Reset
Conn.TxStatus -- need interface function or maybe Reset func
